Analysis on PPD surveys 12/06/2024
===============================

The Philadelphia Police Department (PPD), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, launched a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) survey to assess and advance its efforts toward creating a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. This initiative is centered on fostering an environment that ensures fair treatment for all members, regardless of identity, and is a step toward aligning PPD’s practices with DEI goals. Working closely with the PPD's Interim Director of DEI, the survey was developed and launched on October 23, with a closing date set for November 20. Following the survey's release, PPD’s Director of Communications implemented a comprehensive outreach campaign to encourage maximum participation. Responses were collected both online and mail-in submissions, providing valuable insights into the department’s current climate and areas for improvement in DEI.

This report consists of three sections of analysis: **Basic Responses Distribution**, showing the distribution of respondent locations, dates, and progress; **Demographic Distribution**, covering the distributions of gender, race, sworn status, and years of service; and **Answer Distribution and Word Cloud**, displaying the response distributions and a word cloud for open-ended questions.

# Basic Responses Distribution

We convert IP address to actual cities and countries. All of the results are in United States and following is the distribution of majority cities with more than 5 devices from 1290 survey responses including 4 mail-in responses:

- Philadelphia: 1004 devices
- White Plains: 42 devices
- New York: 23 devices
- Reston: 16 devices
- Lansdale: 8 devices
- Allentown: 7 devices
- St Louis: 7 devices
- Arlington: 6 devices
- Dulles: 6 devices
- Bensalem: 6 devices
- Anaheim: 6 devices

We plot the survey received from each date and its completeness where orange is those fully completed surveys and blue are partially completed surveys:

We also plot the survey's progress distribution that most of them are highly completed:

### Text summary:
-	Heavy qualitative data surrounding Northwestern’s training programs availabilities, but limited availability in PPD 
- Large amounts of results in “training not public”

- people who said never
  - Summary: Majority of those who replied never say that training is simply not or
very scarcely provided or that it is only given to those who know a higher up in
the department (nepotism/favoritism). Many said that opportunities are not made
known and that officers or individual departments had to pay for their own
training and take off on their own time. Some said there was no one to provide
training and that internal leadership was poor or lacking. Lastly, many said MPO
was provided, but that MPO is not enough and will not help for career
advancement.
  - Answers only given once or twice
    - Personal experience bc of race and gender (1)
    - Training only for new cops
    - Only street personnel receive
    - Training not for street personnel bc the are needed on the street
    - Used to receive training but things have changed
    - Mainly offered to non sworn personnel
    - Mainly offered tks worn personnel
    - Instructors subvert their own subjects?
  - Never demographics
- People who said usually
  - Summary: The majority of those who said "yes" described the frequency of
training or the messages they received regarding training, often basing their
answers on personal experience. However, most of these responses mentioned
regular or annual training but did not address career growth, promotion, or the
acquisition of special skills. Although some respondents noted that there is room
for promotion, the majority did not.
  - A small number of responses indicated financial barriers, a lack of knowledge,
favoritism, training being limited to higher-ups or those in forensics, or
dissatisfaction with the quality of available training options. Lastly, a few
respondents mentioned that personnel need to request training more often or that
training is only provided upon request.
- Sometimes
  - Favoritism and Unequal Access (majority of responses)
    - Personal experience of favoritism, you aren't told about training unless
you know someone, many said training is easier for sworn members to get,
some said easier for higher ranked to get etc
- 1 black male said favoritism for certain racial groups
  - Limited Opportunities or Availability (second most popular response type)
    - Few opportunities, not readily available, rarely heard about hard to get
approved etc
  - Barriers to Access
    - Hard to get training that requires time off, financial restrictions, not
enough staff, getting increasing more difficult to get training
  - Mandatory or Basic Training Only
    - Mainly mandatory, just MPO etc
  - Opportunities Present but Limited Impact
    - Yes, but could be more often, Gave an example of training, Yes, but not
based on merit, Yes, but not for career advancement, Yes, but poor
supervisors prevent utilization, Outside places offer advanced training,
College fairs and tuition occasionally offered, Some interoffice transfers
(rare)
  - Available but Underutilized
    - Available and made public but hard to get, Frequent postings, Yes but
training is not set up by the department, Yes but the department doesn’t
take advantage, Occasionally notified
  - Specialized or Advanced Training Gaps
    - Specialized training is offeree, training is more for street officers than
sworn personnel, Not for veterans of dept, hard to find advanced training,
Little offered for supervisors
  - Suggestions for Improvement
    - Expanded training, Better evaluation, Need more training opportunities,
More focus on personnel development, Staff don’t value professional
growth
- Always:
  - Most people said there were lots of opportunities or that opportunities were made
known pretty often. Some pointed to everyone being able to apply and
promotional tests being readily available. There were a few outlier responses
about mental health resources and online training.
- Hardly ever:
  - Summary: Most respondents who selected Hardy ever discussed favoritism in
tehri response. Some talked about budget, being understaffed, the high cost of
training, lack of information about training, a lack of career advancement, bad
quality training, and their own experience being overlooked for training
opportunities.
- Patterns based on Experience:
  - Always: Most likely chosen by those with more than 25 years of experience.
  - Hardly ever: Most likely chosen by those with 16-25 years of experience.
  - Never: Most likely chosen by those with 16-25 years of experience.
