Analysis on PPD surveys 11/21
===============================

The Philadelphia Police Department (PPD), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, launched a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) survey to assess and advance its efforts toward creating a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace. This initiative is centered on fostering an environment that ensures fair treatment for all members, regardless of identity, and is a step toward aligning PPD’s practices with DEI goals. Working closely with the PPD's Interim Director of DEI, the survey was developed and launched on October 23, with a closing date set for November 20. Following the survey's release, PPD’s Director of Communications implemented a comprehensive outreach campaign to encourage maximum participation. Responses were collected both online and mail-in submissions, providing valuable insights into the department’s current climate and areas for improvement in DEI.

This report consists of three sections of analysis: **Basic Responses Distribution**, showing the distribution of respondent locations, dates, and progress; **Demographic Distribution**, covering the distributions of gender, race, sworn status, and years of service; and **Answer Distribution and Word Cloud**, displaying the response distributions and a word cloud for open-ended questions.

# Basic Responses Distribution

We convert IP address to actual cities and countries. All of the results are in United States and following is the distribution of majority cities with more than 5 devices from 1290 survey responses including 4 mail-in responses:

- Philadelphia: 1004 devices
- White Plains: 42 devices
- New York: 23 devices
- Reston: 16 devices
- Lansdale: 8 devices
- Allentown: 7 devices
- St Louis: 7 devices
- Arlington: 6 devices
- Dulles: 6 devices
- Bensalem: 6 devices
- Anaheim: 6 devices

We plot the survey received from each date and its completeness where orange is those fully completed surveys and blue are partially completed surveys:

We also plot the survey's progress distribution:
